                        Since I started learning about technology in 2017, I have learnt a lot in software development, content creation, digital marketing and leadership.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        I am glad to say that after a very long time, I was able to work on 5+ web applications and still working on more. I have written contents which gained me more than 5000 followers on more than 4 platforms plus a community of 1800 people I created since 2018.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        In 2020, I joined <b>Andela Technical Leadership Program (ATLP)</b> which fostered what I already knew and introduced me to the real world of software development, after 9 months in the program I was never the same.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        Again in 2020, I was also able to start my first 2 businesses which failed and after them, I was helped with a team to start <b>Techinika</b> which is changing lives of people wanting to learn technology, and making dreams of businesses come true by solutions we provide.
                        <br></br>
                        <br></br>
                        In 2022, I started <b>My Lovely Africa Podcast</b>. Through this podcast, I want to share life of Africans in Africa, how they feel about Africa, and present Africa to the world.
                        <br></br>

                    <h1>Before I join tech üìµ 2007-2016!</h1>

                    <p>I used to want to become a priest. It&apos;s absurd, right? I know. I was in primary then, and I was very young. But I believe that person&apos;s aspirations and wishes has a close relationship to what the person knows. I was a pupil at a school called <b>Kibali Primary School</b>.</p>
                    <p>After I did <b>Primary National Examination (Done after Primary 6 here in Rwanda üá∑üáº)</b>, I pursued another step on my dreams. I joined Rwesero Minor Seminary (a school for only boys who wanted to become priests) and it was the beginning of my High School journey. I stayed there for one year, and fate called, I had to change the school. That&apos;s when I moved to CDBR (College Don Bosco De Rushaki) and repeated Senior 1. And from there, my dream died.</p>
                    <p>At CDBR, I stayed there for next 3 years for Ordinary Level, and that was going to change my life completely. I started discovering some things on myself, and doing some things, having friends, stuff like that, you know. I started writing poems, songs, doing my old habit of drawing but did not give it much efforts.</p>
                    <p>‚úîÔ∏è That is when I created my first Facebook account! üî•</p>
                    <p>‚úîÔ∏è In 2015, I used smartphone for the first time (was not mine though)! üî•</p>
                    <p>‚úîÔ∏è In 2016, it was my first time using a computer (XO computer) üî•</p>
                    <p>‚úîÔ∏è I applied to attend <b>IPRC Kigali (Best Technical school in Rwanda)</b> out of curiosity (People thought that I would choose science) üî•</p>
                    <p>‚úîÔ∏è In 2016, at the end of the year 31, December I won my own smartphone from Radio Rwanda. üî•</p>

                    <h1>My Journey in Tech ‚ú® 2017 - Present</h1>

                    <p>As I said, I applied to attend IPRC Kigali as my Advanced Level school, and I was successful. I came to the city and was my first time living in the city, but I learned to adapt to situation very fast. I was going to pursue Computer Electronics, but then the curiculum changed, and I found myself in <b>Networking</b>.</p>
                    <p>This is when I started to dive deep into technology. In the class, we were learning just Networking, but aside doing this:</p>
