                <h1>Interesting summary &#128514;&#128514;&#128514;!</h1>

                <p>
                    Since I started learning about technology in 2017, I have learnt a lot in software development, content creation, digital marketing and leadership.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    I am glad to say that after a very long time, I was able to work on 5+ web applications and still working on more. I have written contents which gained me more than 5000 followers on more than 4 platforms plus a community of 1800 people I created since 2018.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    In 2020, I joined <Link href="https://rwanda.andela.com">
                        <a>Andela Technical Leadership Program (ATLP)</a>
                    </Link> which fostered what I already knew and introduced me to the real world of software development, after 9 months in the program I was never the same.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    Again in 2020, I was also able to start my first 2 businesses which failed and after them, I was helped with a team to start <Link href="https://techinika.com">
                        <a>Techinika</a>
                    </Link> which is changing lives of people wanting to learn technology, and making dreams of businesses come true by solutions we provide.
                    <br></br>
                    <br></br>
                    In 2022, I started <Link href="https://mylovelyafrica.podbean.com">
                        <a>My Lovely Africa Podcast</a>
                    </Link>. Through this podcast, I want to share life of Africans in Africa, how they feel about Africa, and present Africa to the world.

                <h1>Before I join tech 📵 2007-2016!</h1>

                <p>I used to want to become a priest. It&apos;s absurd, right? I know. I was in primary then, and I was very young. But I believe that person&apos;s aspirations and wishes has a close relationship to what the person knows. I was a pupil at a school called <b>Kibali Primary School</b>.</p>
                <p>After I did <b>Primary National Examination (Done after Primary 6 here in Rwanda 🇷🇼)</b>, I pursued another step on my dreams. I joined Rwesero Minor Seminary (a school for only boys who wanted to become priests) and it was the beginning of my High School journey. I stayed there for one year, and fate called, I had to change the school. That&apos;s when I moved to CDBR (College Don Bosco De Rushaki) and repeated Senior 1. And from there, my dream died.</p>
                <p>At CDBR, I stayed there for next 3 years for Ordinary Level, and that was going to change my life completely. I started discovering some things on myself, and doing some things, having friends, stuff like that, you know. I started writing poems, songs, doing my old habit of drawing but did not give it much efforts.</p>
                <p>✔️ That is when I created my first Facebook account! 🔥</p>
                <p>✔️ In 2015, I used smartphone for the first time (was not mine though)! 🔥</p>
                <p>✔️ In 2016, it was my first time using a computer (XO computer) 🔥 thanks to OLPC (One Laptop Per Child Program)</p>
                <p>✔️ I applied to attend <Link href="https://iprckigali.rp.ac.rw">
                        <a>IPRC Kigali (The best public technical school in Rwanda)</a>
                    </Link> out of curiosity (People thought that I would choose science) 🔥</p>
                <p>✔️ In 2016, at the end of the year 31, December I won my own smartphone from <Link href="https://rba.co.rw/radio">
                        <a>Radio Rwanda</a>
                    </Link>. 🔥</p>

                <h1>My Journey in Tech ✨ 2017 - Present</h1>

                <p>As I said, I applied to attend IPRC Kigali as my Advanced Level school, and I was successful. I came to the city and was my first time living in the city, but I learned to adapt to situation very fast. I was going to pursue Computer Electronics, but then the curiculum changed, and I found myself in <b>Networking</b>.</p>
                <p>This is when I started to dive deep into technology. In the class, we were learning just Networking, but aside doing this:</p>

                <h4>2017</h4>

                <p>✔️ I started teaching my self HTML and CSS and could make a website, but I was lacking motivation, confidence and design skills.</p>
                <p>✔️ There is no other time I watchred too many movies like 2017. I watched many American TV shows like Into The Badland, The 100, KDrama and many more.🆒</p>
                <p>✔️ In this year, I thought myself how to write Korean Language while also developing my English Skills.</p>
                <p>✔️ This was the year of learning a lot about basics of computers. I learnt, messed up, and re-learnt again, but today I am grateful for that.</p>
                <p>✔️ I created <Link href="https://youtube.com/c/achillesonga">
                        <a>my first YouTube channel</a>
                    </Link> and tried adding contents on it, but failed.</p>

                <h4>2018</h4>

                <p>✔️ I started learning <b>content creation</b>. Mixed my passion for writting with technology.</p>
                <p>✔️ I created more than 2 blogs which was both deleted later after reaching more that 1000 people.</p>
                <p>✔️ I learned what is CMS, and learned how to make a website with a CMS especially <b>WordPress</b> as well as developing my HTML and CSS skills.</p>
                <p>✔️ I attended kLab and Progate developer challenge which introduced me to more complex programming languages like <b>Python and Ruby, and got introduced to a version control Git (That is when I created a <Link href="https://github.com/songa1">
                        <a>Github account</a>
                    </Link>)</b>.</p>
                <p>✔️ In class, I was getting better in <b>Networking (Setting up LAN network, Configuring Wireless network, CCTV Camera installation and more)</b>.</p>

                <h4>2019</h4>

                <p>✔️ With some of my friends and classmates, we started a company <b>(AFRINET) 🧑‍💼</b>.</p>
                <p>✔️ I learned about PHP and started implementing it in some of designs that I had made before.</p>
                <p>✔️ I started <Link href="https://facebook.com/mindinmiddle">
                        <a>The Mind In Middle</a>
                    </Link>. The brand I used to create contents on Facebook and Instagram. This raised my following from 0 t0 400. And I created a community of 1800 people on Facebook with Mind In Middle.</p>
                <p>✔️ I used my idle YouTube channel in September and raised it to 500 subscribers in 3 months.(I was making lyrics videos for Kinyarwanda old school songs) inspired by <Link href="https://rwanda.andela.com">
                        <a>Nettrip</a>
                    </Link> and <Link href="https://rwanda.andela.com">
                        <a>G250Ent</a>
                    </Link>.</p>
                <p>✔️ I class, I was introduced to VPNs, WAN, Windows Servers, and Switching (VLANs, STP, VTP, etc). This was our final year in high school.</p>
                <p>⚡ I lost all coding projects and contents that I had ever created on my disk, because it was old. <b>(Learned to do BACKUP)</b> 😊.</p>

                <p>Until here, I had learned a lot and my high school studies was coming to an end. So what was I going to do next? Did I have any choice? No. I had to figure out my next move. So I registered a simple business. And went home (Northern Province - Gicumbi) for some time.</p>

                <p>After all 12 years of learning, I think a person needs at least a vacation and little celebration. Not big because the way is still too long.</p>

                <h4>2020</h4>

                <p>Anyone remember what happened in 2020? This 🦠(CORONA VIRUS) came as a disaster, but before, I had started my small business which I did for the whole year, with the help of the company we created back in 2019 (remember AFRINET).</p>
                <p>Even though we were in turbulent times, learning continued and change kept appearing:</p>
                <p>🦠 I learned surviving no matter what happens.</p>
                <p>🦠 I trained myself to read books and write an agenda.</p>
                <p>🦠 I got experience in selling and customer care.</p>
                <p>🦠 We started a blog that had a purpose of teaching people technology using Kinyarwanda, that was <b>Nigute.co.rw</b> which later became Techinika.</p>
                <p>🦠 I kept developing my YouTube channel and writing on <Link href="https://rwanda.andela.com">
                        <a>Facebook</a>
                    </Link>.</p>
                <p>🦠 In September, I quit the business and joined <Link href="https://rwanda.andela.com">
                        <a>Andela Technical Leadership Program (ATLP)</a>
                    </Link>, this time my life changed for good. Everything I learned in past years came back to me. HTML, CSS, and then I started Javascript. It was my first time learning Javascript, I started working and learning remotely (COVID culture 👌).</p>
                <p>🦠 We applied for college, and had to wait for the whole year because of the lockdown.</p>

                <b>Until here, the story is getting interesting. Should I continue?</b>

                <h4>2021</h4>
